# Dr. Ye-Chen Lin (林曄辰)
## **About Me**

I am a postdoc of [Instituts of Environmentional Engineering](https://www.ev.nctu.edu.tw/) at [National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University](https://www.nycu.edu.tw/), Taiwan. My research intrests include buliting a mathematical model with analuytcal methods for the problems of groundwater flow response due to aquifer test, solute transport in an unsaturated soils due to the leachate diffusion from a landfill site, heat transfer for evaluating a aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES) system, and stream-aquifer interaction. I specilizes on estimating the aquifer properties via analyzing the drawdown data from aquifer tests, solving the problem by using the integral transformetions such as Laplace, Fourier, Hankel, and Weber transformations.  

I received my PhD in [Instituts of Environmentional Engineering](https://www.ev.nctu.edu.tw/) at [National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University](https://www.nycu.edu.tw/), Taiwan, under the guidance of profssor [Hund-Der Yeh](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hund-Der-Yeh).
