### About Me

I am a postdoc of Instituts of Environmentional Engineering at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taiwan. My research intrests include buliting a mathematical model with analuytcal methods for the problems of groundwater flow response due to aquifer test, solute transport in an unsaturated soils sue to the leachate diffusion from a landfill site, heat transfer for evaluating a aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES) system, and stream-aquifer interaction. I specilizes on estimating the aquifer properties via analyzing the drawdown data from aquifer tests, solving the problem by using the integral transformetions such as Laplace, Fourier, Hankel, and Weber transformations.  

I received my PhD in Instituts of Environmentional Engineering at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taiwan, under the guidance of profssor Hund-Der Yeh.
